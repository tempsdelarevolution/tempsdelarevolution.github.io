            <h3>The French Revolution (Of Time)</h3>
            <p>	The 1790s were a pivotal moment in French history. The foundation that the monarchy was built on started to crumble, Maximilian Robespierre brought the guillotine into raging popularity, and the clocks sitting in people’s homes underwent a huge makeover. Time itself changed during the French Revolution. The National Convention declared in 1792 that the country would be switching from the Gregorian calendar to a new French Republican Calendar in an attempt to distance themselves from monarchist and religious influences. The shift signaled the new “age of reason” that would come to France during this new republic. Despite the newfound enthusiasm for all things secular, the clock never truly caught on and proved to be unpopular to a country accustomed to traditional time. </p>
            <p>	Just like the metric system, which was created at the same time, the decimal clock of the First Republic was meant to be an easier alternative to inconsistent measurements. Instead of 24 hour days, aka "duodecimal time," the decimal clocks split days into 10 hours, with 100 minutes per hour and 100 seconds per minute instead of 60. This makes for simpler math; if one wanted to know what percentage of the day had gone by, one would only need to know how many hours had passed. </p>
            <p>	The clock wasn’t the only thing that changed during the Republic. Instead of starting in January, the calendar year began on the Autumn Equinox (approximately the 23rd of September). To replace the Gregorian calendar in its entirety, the revolutionaries created 12 new months, each with exactly 30 days. To the mathematicians out there, I know what you’re thinking – 12 months of 30 days only adds up to 360, not a full 365. And what about leap years? At the end of each calendar year (approximately mid-September, after the final 30-day month had run its course), they celebrated nearly a week of holidays, five or six days depending on the year. La Fête de la Vertu, La Fête du Génie, La Fête du Travail, La Fête de l’Opinion, and La Fête des Récompenses occurred every year. Every four years – every leap year – the people would celebrate La Fête de la Revolution on the final 366th day of the year, acknowledging the very revolution that gave them this calendar. </p>

            <p>	If this new system sounds confusing, that’s because it is. “Weeks” were now 10 days long instead of 7, and work schedules had to accommodate this. The new clocks were greatly disliked by clockmakers and regular citizens alike – because of the new division, each new second was 0.864 of a regular second. Each new hour was 144 true minutes long. It was difficult for citizens to convert from one time to the other and they struggled with the transition as a result. Since the first day of the year was the Autumn Equinox, a day which could fall on September 22, 23, or 24 based on the solar calendar, the new year began on a different day each cycle. (For ease of calculation, my clock assumes the equinox falls on September 23rd every year. The year I created this, 2023, the equinox falls on the 23rd.)</p>

            <p>	Unsurprisingly, this new calendar was highly unpopular. Though weeks were ten days instead of seven, citizens still received only one day off at the end of the week and worked 9 work days in a row instead of 6. They had to work a full year before they got five days in a row off for holiday – unfortunately, that holiday was situated in the fall during the harvest, an inconvenient time for many to take a vacation. The French, like other predominantly Christian nations, were used to going to church every Sunday. This new calendar made that extremely difficult – this, at least, was entirely on purpose. In attempting to embrace rationalism and secularism, the new system distanced the country from religious influences as best as possible, even at the cost of other glaring issues.</p>
            <p>Unlike the rest of the metric system, decimal time proved to be inconvenient and unpopular. The French Republican Calendar was used until 1806, when Napolean was crowned Emperor and officially abolished it, marking the end of the First Republic. Later, it was brought back in 1871 during the short-lived but enthusiastic Paris Commune, but the only remnants now are confined to museums and history books.</p>

            <h3>The Code</h3>
            <p>	This website was an incredibly enjoyable challenge for me. I estimate it took around 40 hours to complete (ironically, I forgot to time it!) and I learned new techniques and skills to compensate. For context, here’s a quick overview of the code itself. Webpages are built using three coding languages. HTML is used to create the pieces that go in the page – every circle, line, and word has been created with this language. CSS is then used to style the page; this is how you change the color and font and move the objects to where they need to go. Lastly, JavaScript is used to make the website interactive. The hands are able to move because of the written JavaScript function, which also updates the posted time and date. I will link the code <a href="https://github.com/tempsdelarevolution/tempsdelarevolution.github.io">here</a> in case you’d like to check it out – all of it was entirely written from scratch.</p>
            <p>	I started by creating the clock, which proved more challenging than expected. I got help from a GeeksForGeeks tutorial, but wanted to edit the design of the clock to fit a vintage color scheme and wanted the second hand to tick once every second instead of continuously moving. This was solved by calling the function every 1000 milliseconds instead of constantly reiterating. The second clock was also tricky. First, the tick marks around the edges had to be carefully calculated. Then, I wanted the new second hand to move independently of the first second hand, because a single “second” is not the same amount of time for both clocks. This was solved by creating a second function for the second clock and calling that one every 864 milliseconds instead of 1000. </p>
            <p>	The function works as such: at any given point, the code will request the computer for the exact date and time. I used the UTC time zone and added two hours instead of the local time zone so this website will show the correct date and time in Paris no matter where the user is. The code will use that time and update the first clock: rotate each hand a certain number of degrees, and then wait exactly 1000 milliseconds before repeating. The second clock takes the current exact time, converts that to decimal time, and adjusts the hands accordingly. </p>
            <p>	The next step was to do some quick maths to calculate exactly how far each hand needs to move at any given moment. Spoiler alert: these maths were not quick. I had to run my calculations several times until I landed on the correct answer. </p>
            <p>For example: </p>
            <p>There are 24(60)(60)=86,400 seconds in a full day.</p>
            <p>	Assume the current Paris time is 10:20:30. Calculate how many seconds have passed. </p>
            <p>	10(3600) + 20(60) + 30 =  36,000 + 1,200 + 30 = 37,230 seconds</p>
            <p>	What percentage of the day has passed? 37,230/86,400 = 43.09 %</p>
            <p>	The hour hand needs to move (360 degrees) x (43.09 percent) = 155.125 degrees from it’s original position. Because over 40 percent of the day has passed but less than 50 percent, the current hour is 4. </p>
            <p>	To calculate the position of the minute hand, compute the remainder of the hour that we have and convert that to minutes.  </p>
            <p>	Therefore, the remainder of the hour we have is given by modular division: 4.309 mod 1 = 0.309</p>
            <p>	Because there are 100 ‘minutes’ in one revolutionary hour, the number of minutes is given by 0.309 hours x 100 = 30.9 minutes</p>
            <p>Therefore the current number of minutes is 30 and the minute hand must be updated by 360 x 0.309 = 111.24 degrees</p>
            <p>Repeat this process for the seconds. </p>
            <p>	Calculating the day was equally as tedious. My code assumes the first day of the year falls on September 23 and that this day is Primidi, the first day of the week. The code checks if it is currently a leap year and based on that response runs one of two calculations to determine the month and the day of that month, then the weekday this would be. (Fun fact- the day I got that code to work and display the date was the tenth weekday, the tenth day of the tenth month. Decadi, 10 Messidor.)  If you're lucky enough to be visiting this site between September 17 and 22, you'd see that instead of a date the holiday name is displayed. Since these days do not follow the proper conventions of month, day, or weekday, I replaced that in its entirety.</p>
            <p>To a programmer in a history class, this project was a dream come true. Although I enjoyed our field trips and lively discussions, this was a meaningful way for me to engage with the material on my own terms. I'm grateful for the opportunity I've had to take this class, and though history will never be my passion, I was happy to step outside my comfort zone this summer.</p>
